Whatever I code for fun and learning

beat_iss_sim.py: a script that should beat the game https://iss-sim.spacex.com. It is useful to practice control law design and image processing for OCR, as well as a bit of real-time SW development
iss_sim: a config file that is used by beat_iss_sim, should be placed in <Tesseract home folder>\tessdata\configs
